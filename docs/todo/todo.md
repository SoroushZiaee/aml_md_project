Hi Farhad,
 
Thanks for taking the time to catch up today.
 
Please see Excel spreadsheet for another transplant outcome interest – NRM (non-relapse mortality).
 
As it suggests, this reflects death of a patient prior to disease relapse (coded as “1”).
 
For a patient who relapsed, they are censored (coded as “0”).
 
For a patient who did not relapse and did not die, they are coded as a “2”.
 
Many thanks with your help with this.
 
Kind regards,
Ray
