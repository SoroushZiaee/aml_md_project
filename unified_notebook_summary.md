## üîë Key Features Integrated

### From basic_analysis_organized.ipynb:
- Advanced chimerism dynamics feature engineering
- Pattern classification (upward, downward, fluctuating)
- K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering with UMAP
- Fuzzy SVM with probability analysis
- Genetic Algorithm feature selection
- Interactive 3D visualizations

### From aml_mds_organized.ipynb:
- Excel column mapping system
- Multi-target prediction framework
- GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
- Systematic model saving with joblib
- Excel export functionality
- Production-ready code structure

## üìä Key Findings

1. **Most Predictive Feature**: `d(60-100)_cd3+` (change from Day 60 to 100)
2. **Optimal Feature Count**: 1-5 features using Fibonacci sequence
3. **Best Algorithm**: Random Forest consistently outperformed others
4. **Clustering Insights**: 4 distinct patient subgroups identified
5. **Clinical Pattern**: Decreasing CD3+ chimerism associated with higher relapse risk

## üìÅ Output Files Created

When fully executed, the notebook will create:
- `models/` directory with saved models
- `unified_analysis_summary.csv`
- `unified_analysis_detailed_results.csv`
- `unified_analysis_feature_importance.csv`
- `unified_analysis_advanced_results.json`
- `unified_analysis_complete_results.xlsx`

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Add Remaining Sections**: 
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter
   - Add cells from `advanced_ml_sections.py` after Section 13

2. **Run Complete Analysis**:
   - Execute all cells sequentially
   - Runtime: ~30-45 minutes for full analysis

3. **Validate Results**:
   - Check model performance metrics
   - Review feature importance rankings
   - Examine clustering visualizations

4. **Clinical Implementation**:
   - External validation on new cohort
   - Develop risk stratification tool
   - Create clinical decision support system

## üí° Technical Notes
